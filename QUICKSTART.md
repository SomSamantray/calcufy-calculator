- ChatGPT Plus/Team subscription

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ~/Documents/"Calculator app"
npm install
```

## Step 2: Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates:
- `dist/server.js` - Compiled MCP server
- `assets/` - Widget bundles (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel
```

Answer the prompts:
- Set up and deploy? **Y**
- Project name? **calcufy-calculator**
- Directory? **./&**
- Override settings? **N**

Copy your deployment URL (e.g., `https://calcufy-calculator-xyz.vercel.app`)

## Step 4: Set Environment Variable

```bash
vercel env add OPENAI_WIDGET_HOST production
```

Paste your deployment URL when prompted.

Deploy to production:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Step 5: Configure ChatGPT

1. Go to https://chatgpt.com
2. Settings â†’ Apps & Connectors
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Create"
5. Fill in:
   - Name: **Calcufy Calculator**
   - MCP URL: **https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/mcp**
   - Authentication: **No authentication**
   - Check: **I trust this application**
6. Click Create

## Step 6: Test It!

Start a new chat and try:

```
"Using Calcufy Calculator, add 5 and 3"
```

You should see:
1. A beautiful carousel with 4 operation cards
2. Click "Select" on Addition
3. Enter 5 and 3
4. See animated result: 5 + 3 = 8

## Troubleshooting

**Widgets don't appear?**
- Verify OPENAI_WIDGET_HOST is set: `vercel env ls`
- Check assets are accessible: Visit `https://your-url/assets/operation-selector.js`

**MCP server errors?**
- View logs: `vercel logs`
- Test health endpoint: `curl https://your-url/health`

**ChatGPT can't connect?**
- Double-check the MCP URL (must end with `/mcp`)
- Try deleting and recreating the app
